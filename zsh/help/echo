echo [ -neE ] [ arg ... ]
       Write  each  arg  on the standard output, with a space separating each one.  If the -n flag is not present, print a
       newline at the end.  echo recognizes the following escape sequences:

       \a     bell character
       \b     backspace
       \c     suppress final newline
       \e     escape
       \f     form feed
       \n     linefeed (newline)
       \r     carriage return
       \t     horizontal tab
       \v     vertical tab
       \\     backslash
       \0NNN  character code in octal
       \xNN   character code in hexadecimal
       \uNNNN unicode character code in hexadecimal
       \UNNNNNNNN
              unicode character code in hexadecimal

       The -E flag, or the BSD ECHO option, can be used to disable these escape sequences.  In the latter  case,  -e  flag
       can be used to enable them.
