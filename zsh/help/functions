functions [ {+|-}UXkmtuz ] [ name ... ]
functions -M mathfn [ min [ max [ shellfn ] ] ]
functions -M [ -m pattern ... ]
functions +M [ -m ] mathfn
       Equivalent to typeset -f, with the exception of the -M option.  Use of the -M option may not be combined  with  any
       of the options handled by typeset -f.

       functions  -M  mathfn defines mathfn as the name of a mathematical function recognised in all forms of arithmetical
       expressions; see the section `Arithmetic Evaluation' in zshmisc(1).  By default  mathfn  may  take  any  number  of
       comma-separated  arguments.  If min is given, it must have exactly min args; if min and max are both given, it must
       have at least min and at most max args.  max may be -1 to indicate that there is no upper limit.

       By default the function is implemented by a shell function of the same name; if shellfn is specified it  gives  the
       name  of the corresponding shell function while mathfn remains the name used in arithmetical expressions.  The name
       of the function in $0 is mathfn (not shellfn as would usually be the case), provided the option FUNCTION ARGZERO is
       in  effect.   The positional parameters in the shell function correspond to the arguments of the mathematical func‐
       tion call.  The result of the last arithmetical expression evaluated inside the shell function (even  if  it  is  a
       form that normally only returns a status) gives the result of the mathematical function.

       functions  -M  with  no arguments lists all such user-defined functions in the same form as a definition.  With the
       additional option -m and a list of arguments, all functions whose mathfn matches one of the pattern  arguments  are
       listed.

       function  +M removes the list of mathematical functions; with the additional option -m the arguments are treated as
       patterns and all functions whose mathfn matches the pattern are removed.  Note that the shell function implementing
       the behaviour is not removed (regardless of whether its name coincides with mathfn).

       For example, the following prints the cube of 3:

              zmath cube() { (( $1 * $1 * $1 )) }
              functions -M cube 1 1 zmath cube
              print $(( cube(3) ))

autoload [ {+|-}UXktz ] [ -w ] [ name ... ]
       Equivalent to functions -u, with the exception of -X/+X and -w.

       The  flag  -X  may  be used only inside a shell function, and may not be followed by a name.  It causes the calling
       function to be marked for autoloading and then immediately loaded and executed, with the  current  array  of  posi‐
       tional  parameters as arguments.  This replaces the previous definition of the function.  If no function definition
       is found, an error is printed and the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading.

       The flag +X attempts to load each name as an autoloaded function, but does not execute it.  The exit status is zero
       (success)  if the function was not previously defined and a definition for it was found.  This does not replace any
       existing definition of the function.  The exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was already  defined  or
       when  no  definition  was found.  In the latter case the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading.  If
       ksh-style autoloading is enabled, the function created will contain the contents of the file plus  a  call  to  the
       function itself appended to it, thus giving normal ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function.

       With  the  -w  flag,  the  names  are taken as names of files compiled with the zcompile builtin, and all functions
       defined in them are marked for autoloading.

       The flags -z and -k mark the function to be autoloaded in native or ksh emulation, as if  the  option  KSH AUTOLOAD
       were  unset  or  were  set, respectively.  The flags override the setting of the option at the time the function is
       loaded.
