return [ n ]
       Causes a shell function or `.' script to return to the invoking script with the return status specified by n.  If n
       is omitted, the return status is that of the last command executed.

       If return was executed from a trap in a TRAPNAL function, the effect is different for zero and non-zero return sta‐
       tus.  With zero status (or after an implicit return at the end of the trap), the shell will return to  whatever  it
       was previously processing; with a non-zero status, the shell will behave as interrupted except that the return sta‐
       tus of the trap is retained.  Note that the numeric value of the signal which caused the  trap  is  passed  as  the
       first  argument,  so  the  statement `return $((128+$1))' will return the same status as if the signal had not been
       trapped.
