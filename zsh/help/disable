disable [ -afmrs ] name ...
       Temporarily disable the named hash table elements.  The default is to disable builtin commands.  This allows you to
       use an external command with the same name as a builtin command.  The -a option causes disable to act on regular or
       global aliases.  The -s option causes disable to act on suffix aliases.  The -f option causes  disable  to  act  on
       shell  functions.  The -r options causes disable to act on reserved words.  Without arguments all disabled hash ta‚Äê
       ble elements from the corresponding hash table are printed.  With the -m flag the arguments are taken  as  patterns
       (which  should  be quoted to prevent them from undergoing filename expansion), and all hash table elements from the
       corresponding hash table matching these patterns are disabled.  Disabled objects can be  enabled  with  the  enable
       command.
