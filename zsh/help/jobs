jobs [ -dlprs ] [ job ... ]
jobs -Z string
       Lists  information  about each given job, or all jobs if job is omitted.  The -l flag lists process IDs, and the -p
       flag lists process groups.  If the -r flag is specified only running jobs will be listed and  if  the  -s  flag  is
       given  only  stopped  jobs are shown.  If the -d flag is given, the directory from which the job was started (which
       may not be the current directory of the job) will also be shown.

       The -Z option replaces the shell's argument and environment space with the given string, truncated if necessary  to
       fit.  This will normally be visible in ps (ps(1)) listings.  This feature is typically used by daemons, to indicate
       their state.
