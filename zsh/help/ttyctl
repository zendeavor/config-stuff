ttyctl -fu
       The -f option freezes the tty, and -u unfreezes it.  When the tty is frozen, no changes made to the tty settings by
       external programs will be honored by the shell, except for changes in the size of the screen; the shell will simply
       reset  the settings to their previous values as soon as each command exits or is suspended.  Thus, stty and similar
       programs have no effect when the tty is frozen.  Without options it reports whether the terminal is frozen or not.
