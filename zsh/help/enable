enable [ -afmrs ] name ...
       Enable  the  named hash table elements, presumably disabled earlier with disable.  The default is to enable builtin
       commands.  The -a option causes enable to act on regular or global aliases.  The -s option causes enable to act  on
       suffix  aliases.   The  -f  option  causes enable to act on shell functions.  The -r option causes enable to act on
       reserved words.  Without arguments all enabled hash table elements from the corresponding hash table  are  printed.
       With the -m flag the arguments are taken as patterns (should be quoted) and all hash table elements from the corre‚Äê
       sponding hash table matching these patterns are enabled.  Enabled objects can be disabled with the disable  builtin
       command.
