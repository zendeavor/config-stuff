pushd [ -qsLP ] [ arg ]
pushd [ -qsLP ] old new
pushd [ -qsLP ] {+|-}n
       Change  the  current  directory,  and  push the old current directory onto the directory stack.  In the first form,
       change the current directory to arg.  If arg is not specified, change to the second directory on  the  stack  (that
       is,  exchange  the  top two entries), or change to $HOME if the PUSHD TO HOME option is set or if there is only one
       entry on the stack.  Otherwise, arg is interpreted as it would be by cd.  The meaning of old and new in the  second
       form is also the same as for cd.

       The  third form of pushd changes directory by rotating the directory list.  An argument of the form `+n' identifies
       a stack entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the dirs command, starting with zero.  An argument  of
       the form `-n' counts from the right.  If the PUSHD MINUS option is set, the meanings of `+' and `-' in this context
       are swapped.

       If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function chpwd and the functions in the array $chpwd functions  are
       not  called,  and the new directory stack is not printed.  This is useful for calls to pushd that do not change the
       environment seen by an interactive user.

       If the option -q is not specified and the shell option PUSHD SILENT is not set, the directory stack will be printed
       after a pushd is performed.

       The options -s, -L and -P have the same meanings as for the cd builtin.
