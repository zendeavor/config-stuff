whence [ -vcwfpams ] name ...
       For each name, indicate how it would be interpreted if used as a command name.

       -v     Produce a more verbose report.

       -c     Print the results in a csh-like format.  This takes precedence over -v.

       -w     For  each  name, print `name: word' where word is one of alias, builtin, command, function, hashed, reserved
              or none, according as name corresponds to an alias, a built-in command, an external command, a  shell  func‚Äê
              tion, a command defined with the hash builtin, a reserved word, or is not recognised.  This takes precedence
              over -v and -c.

       -f     Causes the contents of a shell function to be displayed, which would otherwise not happen unless the -c flag
              were used.

       -p     Do a path search for name even if it is an alias, reserved word, shell function or builtin.

       -a     Do  a search for all occurrences of name throughout the command path.  Normally only the first occurrence is
              printed.

       -m     The arguments are taken as patterns (should be quoted), and the information is displayed  for  each  command
              matching one of these patterns.

       -s     If a pathname contains symlinks, print the symlink-free pathname as well.
