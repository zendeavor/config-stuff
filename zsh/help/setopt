setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option name ] [ name ... ]
       Set the options for the shell.  All options specified either with flags or by name are set.

       If no arguments are supplied, the names of all options currently set are printed.  The form is chosen so as to min‚Äê
       imize the differences from the default options for the current emulation (the default emulation being  native  zsh,
       shown as <Z> in zshoptions(1)).  Options that are on by default for the emulation are shown with the prefix no only
       if they are off, while other options are shown without the prefix no and only if  they  are  on.   In  addition  to
       options  changed from the default state by the user, any options activated automatically by the shell (for example,
       SHIN STDIN  or  INTERACTIVE)  will  be  shown  in  the  list.   The  format  is  further  modified  by  the  option
       KSH OPTION PRINT, however the rationale for choosing options with or without the no prefix remains the same in this
       case.

       If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to protect them  from  filename
       expansion), and all options with names matching these patterns are set.
