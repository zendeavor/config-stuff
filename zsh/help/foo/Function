Function names and definitions may be listed with the -f option to the declare or typeset builtin commands.  The -F option
to declare or typeset will list the function names only (and optionally the source file and line number, if  the  extdebug
shell  option is enabled).  Functions may be exported so that subshells automatically have them defined with the -f option
to the export builtin.  A function definition may be deleted using the -f option to the unset builtin.   Note  that  shell
functions  and  variables with the same name may result in multiple identically-named entries in the environment passed to
the shell's children.  Care should be taken in cases where this may cause a problem.
