Command substitution, commands grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous commands are invoked in a  subshell  environment
that is a duplicate of the shell environment, except that traps caught by the shell are reset to the values that the shell
inherited from its parent at invocation.  Builtin commands that are invoked as part of a pipeline are also executed  in  a
subshell environment.  Changes made to the subshell environment cannot affect the shell's execution environment.
