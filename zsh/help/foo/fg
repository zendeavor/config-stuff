fg [jobspec]
       Resume  jobspec  in  the foreground, and make it the current job.  If jobspec is not present, the shell's notion of
       the current job is used.  The return value is that of the command placed into the foreground,  or  failure  if  run
       when job control is disabled or, when run with job control enabled, if jobspec does not specify a valid job or job‚Äê
       spec specifies a job that was started without job control.
