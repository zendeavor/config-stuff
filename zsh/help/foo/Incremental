Incremental  searches begin before the user has finished typing the search string.  As each character of the search string
is typed, readline displays the next entry from the history matching the string  typed  so  far.   An  incremental  search
requires  only as many characters as needed to find the desired history entry.  The characters present in the value of the
isearch-terminators variable are used to terminate an incremental search.  If that variable has not been assigned a  value
the  Escape and Control-J characters will terminate an incremental search.  Control-G will abort an incremental search and
restore the original line.  When the search is terminated, the history entry containing the search string becomes the cur‚Äê
rent line.
