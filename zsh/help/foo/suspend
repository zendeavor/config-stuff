suspend [-f]
       Suspend  the execution of this shell until it receives a SIGCONT signal.  A login shell cannot be suspended; the -f
       option can be used to override this and force the suspension.  The return status is 0 unless the shell is  a  login
       shell and -f is not supplied, or if job control is not enabled.
