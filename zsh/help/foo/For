For instance, assuming that there is a library of compspecs, each kept in a file corresponding to the name of the command,
the following default completion function would load completions dynamically:

 completion loader()
{
     . "/etc/bash completion.d/$1.sh" >/dev/null 2>&1 && return 124
}
complete -D -F  completion loader
