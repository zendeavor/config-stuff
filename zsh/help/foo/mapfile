mapfile [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
readarray [-n count] [-O origin] [-s count] [-t] [-u fd] [-C callback] [-c quantum] [array]
       Read  lines  from  the  standard  input into the indexed array variable array, or from file descriptor fd if the -u
       option is supplied.  The variable MAPFILE is the default array.  Options, if supplied, have the following meanings:
       -n     Copy at most count lines.  If count is 0, all lines are copied.
       -O     Begin assigning to array at index origin.  The default index is 0.
       -s     Discard the first count lines read.
       -t     Remove a trailing newline from each line read.
       -u     Read lines from file descriptor fd instead of the standard input.
       -C     Evaluate callback each time quantum lines are read.  The -c option specifies quantum.
       -c     Specify the number of lines read between each call to callback.

       If -C is specified without -c, the default quantum is 5000.  When callback is evaluated, it is supplied  the  index
       of  the  next  array  element  to  be assigned and the line to be assigned to that element as additional arguments.
       callback is evaluated after the line is read but before the array element is assigned.

       If not supplied with an explicit origin, mapfile will clear array before assigning to it.

       mapfile returns successfully unless an invalid  option  or  option  argument  is  supplied,  array  is  invalid  or
       unassignable, or if array is not an indexed array.
