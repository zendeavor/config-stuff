compopt [-o option] [-DE] [+o option] [name]
       Modify  completion  options for each name according to the options, or for the currently-executing completion if no
       names are supplied.  If no options are given, display the completion options for each name or the  current  comple‐
       tion.  The possible values of option are those valid for the complete builtin described above.  The -D option indi‐
       cates that the remaining options should apply to the ``default'' command completion; that is, completion  attempted
       on  a  command  for  which  no  completion has previously been defined.  The -E option indicates that the remaining
       options should apply to ``empty'' command completion; that is, completion attempted on a blank line.

       The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, an attempt is made to modify the options for a  name
       for which no completion specification exists, or an output error occurs.
