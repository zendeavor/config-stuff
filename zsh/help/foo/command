command [-pVv] command [arg ...]
       Run command with args suppressing the normal shell function lookup. Only builtin commands or commands found in  the
       PATH  are  executed.  If the -p option is given, the search for command is performed using a default value for PATH
       that is guaranteed to find all of the standard utilities.  If either the -V or -v option is supplied, a description
       of  command is printed.  The -v option causes a single word indicating the command or file name used to invoke com‐
       mand to be displayed; the -V option produces a more verbose description.  If the -V or -v option is  supplied,  the
       exit  status  is 0 if command was found, and 1 if not.  If neither option is supplied and an error occurred or com‐
       mand cannot be found, the exit status is 127.  Otherwise, the exit status of the command builtin is the exit status
       of command.
