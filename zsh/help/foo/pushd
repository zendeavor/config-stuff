pushd [-n] [+n] [-n]
pushd [-n] [dir]
       Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making the new top of the stack the  cur‚Äê
       rent  working  directory.  With no arguments, exchanges the top two directories and returns 0, unless the directory
       stack is empty.  Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
       -n     Suppresses the normal change of directory when adding directories to the stack, so that only  the  stack  is
              manipulated.
       +n     Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with
              zero) is at the top.
       -n     Rotates the stack so that the nth directory (counting from the right of the list  shown  by  dirs,  starting
              with zero) is at the top.
       dir    Adds dir to the directory stack at the top, making it the new current working directory.

       If the pushd command is successful, a dirs is performed as well.  If the first form is used, pushd returns 0 unless
       the cd to dir fails.  With the second form, pushd returns 0 unless the directory stack  is  empty,  a  non-existent
       directory stack element is specified, or the directory change to the specified new current directory fails.
