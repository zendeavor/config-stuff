bind readline-command
       Display current readline key and function bindings, bind a key sequence to a readline function or macro, or  set  a
       readline  variable.  Each non-option argument is a command as it would appear in .inputrc, but each binding or com‐
       mand must be passed as a separate argument; e.g., '"\C-x\C-r": re-read-init-file'.  Options, if supplied, have  the
       following meanings:
       -m keymap
              Use  keymap  as  the  keymap  to be affected by the subsequent bindings.  Acceptable keymap names are emacs,
              emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert.  vi is equivalent to vi-com‐
              mand; emacs is equivalent to emacs-standard.
       -l     List the names of all readline functions.
       -p     Display readline function names and bindings in such a way that they can be re-read.
       -P     List current readline function names and bindings.
       -s     Display  readline  key  sequences bound to macros and the strings they output in such a way that they can be
              re-read.
       -S     Display readline key sequences bound to macros and the strings they output.
       -v     Display readline variable names and values in such a way that they can be re-read.
       -V     List current readline variable names and values.
       -f filename
              Read key bindings from filename.
       -q function
              Query about which keys invoke the named function.
       -u function
              Unbind all keys bound to the named function.
       -r keyseq
              Remove any current binding for keyseq.
       -x keyseq:shell-command
              Cause shell-command to be executed whenever keyseq is entered.  When shell-command is  executed,  the  shell
              sets  the READLINE LINE variable to the contents of the readline line buffer and the READLINE POINT variable
              to the current location of the insertion point.  If the executed command changes the value of  READLINE LINE
              or READLINE POINT, those new values will be reflected in the editing state.

       The return value is 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurred.
