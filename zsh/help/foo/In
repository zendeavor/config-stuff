In addition to the GNU Emacs style escape sequences, a second set of backslash escapes is available:
       \a     alert (bell)
       \b     backspace
       \d     delete
       \f     form feed
       \n     newline
       \r     carriage return
       \t     horizontal tab
       \v     vertical tab
       \nnn   the eight-bit character whose value is the octal value nnn (one to three digits)
       \xHH   the eight-bit character whose value is the hexadecimal value HH (one or two hex digits)
