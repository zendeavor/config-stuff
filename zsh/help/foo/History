History expansion is performed immediately after a complete line is read, before the shell breaks it into words.  It takes
place in two parts.  The first is to determine which line from the history list to use during substitution.  The second is
to  select portions of that line for inclusion into the current one.  The line selected from the history is the event, and
the portions of that line that are acted upon are words.  Various modifiers  are  available  to  manipulate  the  selected
words.   The  line is broken into words in the same fashion as when reading input, so that several metacharacter-separated
words surrounded by quotes are considered one word.  History expansions are introduced by the appearance  of  the  history
expansion  character, which is ! by default.  Only backslash (\) and single quotes can quote the history expansion charac‚Äê
ter.
