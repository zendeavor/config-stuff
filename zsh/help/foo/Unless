Unless otherwise noted, each builtin command documented in this section as accepting options preceded by - accepts  --  to
signify  the  end  of  the  options.  The :, true, false, and test builtins do not accept options and do not treat -- spe‐
cially.  The exit, logout, break, continue, let, and shift builtins accept and process arguments beginning with -  without
requiring  --.  Other builtins that accept arguments but are not specified as accepting options interpret arguments begin‐
ning with - as invalid options and require -- to prevent this interpretation.
: [arguments]
       No effect; the command does nothing beyond expanding arguments and performing any specified redirections.   A  zero
       exit code is returned.

 .  filename [arguments]
source filename [arguments]
       Read  and  execute  commands  from filename in the current shell environment and return the exit status of the last
       command executed from filename.  If filename does not contain a slash, file names in PATH  are  used  to  find  the
       directory  containing  filename.   The file searched for in PATH need not be executable.  When bash is not in posix
       mode, the current directory is searched if no file is found in PATH.  If the sourcepath option to the shopt builtin
       command is turned off, the PATH is not searched.  If any arguments are supplied, they become the positional parame‐
       ters when filename is executed.  Otherwise the positional parameters are unchanged.  The return status is the  sta‐
       tus  of  the  last  command  exited within the script (0 if no commands are executed), and false if filename is not
       found or cannot be read.
