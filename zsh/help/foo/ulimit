ulimit [-HSTabcdefilmnpqrstuvx [limit]]
       Provides control over the resources available to the shell and to processes started by it, on  systems  that  allow
       such  control.   The  -H  and -S options specify that the hard or soft limit is set for the given resource.  A hard
       limit cannot be increased by a non-root user once it is set; a soft limit may be increased up to the value  of  the
       hard limit.  If neither -H nor -S is specified, both the soft and hard limits are set.  The value of limit can be a
       number in the unit specified for the resource or one of the special values hard, soft, or  unlimited,  which  stand
       for  the  current hard limit, the current soft limit, and no limit, respectively.  If limit is omitted, the current
       value of the soft limit of the resource is printed, unless the -H option is given.  When more than one resource  is
       specified, the limit name and unit are printed before the value.  Other options are interpreted as follows:
       -a     All current limits are reported
       -b     The maximum socket buffer size
       -c     The maximum size of core files created
       -d     The maximum size of a process's data segment
       -e     The maximum scheduling priority ("nice")
       -f     The maximum size of files written by the shell and its children
       -i     The maximum number of pending signals
       -l     The maximum size that may be locked into memory
       -m     The maximum resident set size (many systems do not honor this limit)
       -n     The maximum number of open file descriptors (most systems do not allow this value to be set)
       -p     The pipe size in 512-byte blocks (this may not be set)
       -q     The maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues
       -r     The maximum real-time scheduling priority
       -s     The maximum stack size
       -t     The maximum amount of cpu time in seconds
       -u     The maximum number of processes available to a single user
       -v     The maximum amount of virtual memory available to the shell and, on some systems, to its children
       -x     The maximum number of file locks
       -T     The maximum number of threads

       If  limit is given, it is the new value of the specified resource (the -a option is display only).  If no option is
       given, then -f is assumed.  Values are in 1024-byte increments, except for -t, which is in seconds, -p, which is in
       units  of  512-byte  blocks,  and  -T, -b, -n, and -u, which are unscaled values.  The return status is 0 unless an
       invalid option or argument is supplied, or an error occurs while setting a new limit.
