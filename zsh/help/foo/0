0 (zero)
       The zeroth word.  For the shell, this is the command word.
n      The nth word.
^      The first argument.  That is, word 1.
$      The last argument.
%      The word matched by the most recent `?string?' search.
x-y    A range of words; `-y' abbreviates `0-y'.
*      All of the words but the zeroth.  This is a synonym for `1-$'.  It is not an error to use * if there  is  just  one
       word in the event; the empty string is returned in that case.
x*     Abbreviates x-$.
x-     Abbreviates x-$ like x*, but omits the last word.
