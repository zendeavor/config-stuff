dirs [+n] [-n] [-clpv]
       Without options, displays the list of currently remembered directories.  The default display is on  a  single  line
       with  directory names separated by spaces.  Directories are added to the list with the pushd command; the popd com‐
       mand removes entries from the list.
       +n     Displays the nth entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs when invoked without options, start‐
              ing with zero.
       -n     Displays  the  nth  entry  counting  from  the right of the list shown by dirs when invoked without options,
              starting with zero.
       -c     Clears the directory stack by deleting all of the entries.
       -l     Produces a longer listing; the default listing format uses a tilde to denote the home directory.
       -p     Print the directory stack with one entry per line.
       -v     Print the directory stack with one entry per line, prefixing each entry with its index in the stack.

       The return value is 0 unless an invalid option is supplied or n indexes beyond the end of the directory stack.
