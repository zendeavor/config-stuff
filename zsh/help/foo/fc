fc [-e ename] [-lnr] [first] [last]
fc -s [pat=rep] [cmd]
       Fix Command.  In the first form, a range of commands from first to last is selected from the history  list.   First
       and  last  may  be specified as a string (to locate the last command beginning with that string) or as a number (an
       index into the history list, where a negative number is used as an offset from the  current  command  number).   If
       last  is  not specified it is set to the current command for listing (so that ``fc -l -10'' prints the last 10 com‐
       mands) and to first otherwise.  If first is not specified it is set to the previous command for editing and -16 for
       listing.

       The  -n  option suppresses the command numbers when listing.  The -r option reverses the order of the commands.  If
       the -l option is given, the commands are listed on standard output.   Otherwise,  the  editor  given  by  ename  is
       invoked  on a file containing those commands.  If ename is not given, the value of the FCEDIT variable is used, and
       the value of EDITOR if FCEDIT is not set.  If neither variable is set, vi is used.  When editing is  complete,  the
       edited commands are echoed and executed.

       In  the  second  form, command is re-executed after each instance of pat is replaced by rep.  A useful alias to use
       with this is ``r="fc -s"'', so that typing ``r cc'' runs the last command beginning with ``cc''  and  typing  ``r''
       re-executes the last command.

       If  the  first form is used, the return value is 0 unless an invalid option is encountered or first or last specify
       history lines out of range.  If the -e option is supplied, the return value is the value of the last  command  exe‐
       cuted  or  failure  if an error occurs with the temporary file of commands.  If the second form is used, the return
       status is that of the command re-executed, unless cmd does not specify a valid  history  line,  in  which  case  fc
       returns failure.
