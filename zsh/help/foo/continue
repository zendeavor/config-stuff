continue [n]
       Resume the next iteration of the enclosing for, while, until, or select loop.  If n is specified, resume at the nth
       enclosing loop.  n must be â‰¥ 1.  If n is greater than the number of enclosing loops, the last enclosing  loop  (the
       ``top-level'' loop) is resumed.  The return value is 0 unless n is not greater than or equal to 1.
