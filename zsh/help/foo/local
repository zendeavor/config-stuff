local [option] [name[=value] ...]
       For  each  argument,  a  local  variable  named  name is created, and assigned value.  The option can be any of the
       options accepted by declare.  When local is used within a function, it causes the variable name to have  a  visible
       scope  restricted  to  that function and its children.  With no operands, local writes a list of local variables to
       the standard output.  It is an error to use local when not within a function.  The return status is 0 unless  local
       is used outside a function, an invalid name is supplied, or name is a readonly variable.
