alias [-p] [name[=value] ...]
       Alias with no arguments or with the -p option prints the list of aliases in the form alias name=value  on  standard
       output.   When arguments are supplied, an alias is defined for each name whose value is given.  A trailing space in
       value causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded.  For each name  in  the
       argument  list  for  which  no  value  is supplied, the name and value of the alias is printed.  Alias returns true
       unless a name is given for which no alias has been defined.
