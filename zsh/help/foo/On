On  startup,  the history is initialized from the file named by the variable HISTFILE (default ~/.bash history).  The file
named by the value of HISTFILE is truncated, if necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines  specified  by  the
value of HISTFILESIZE.  When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history comment character followed immedi‚Äê
ately by a digit are interpreted as timestamps for the preceding history line.  These timestamps are optionally  displayed
depending  on  the  value  of  the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable.  When an interactive shell exits, the last $HISTSIZE lines are
copied from the history list to $HISTFILE.  If the histappend shell option is enabled (see the description of shopt  under
SHELL  BUILTIN COMMANDS below), the lines are appended to the history file, otherwise the history file is overwritten.  If
HISTFILE is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is not saved.  If the HISTTIMEFORMAT variable is set,
time  stamps  are  written to the history file, marked with the history comment character, so they may be preserved across
shell sessions.  This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from other history lines.  After saving
the  history,  the  history  file is truncated to contain no more than HISTFILESIZE lines.  If HISTFILESIZE is not set, no
truncation is performed.
