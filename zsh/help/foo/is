is used similarly to duplicate output file descriptors.  If n is not specified, the standard output (file descriptor 1) is
used.   If  the digits in word do not specify a file descriptor open for output, a redirection error occurs.  As a special
case, if n is omitted, and word does not expand to one or more digits, the standard output and standard  error  are  redi‚Äê
rected as described previously.
