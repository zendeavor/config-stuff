Several shell options settable with the shopt builtin may be used to tailor the behavior of  history  expansion.   If  the
histverify  shell  option is enabled (see the description of the shopt builtin below), and readline is being used, history
substitutions are not immediately passed to the shell parser.  Instead, the expanded line is reloaded  into  the  readline
editing  buffer for further modification.  If readline is being used, and the histreedit shell option is enabled, a failed
history substitution will be reloaded into the readline editing buffer for correction.   The  -p  option  to  the  history
builtin command may be used to see what a history expansion will do before using it.  The -s option to the history builtin
may be used to add commands to the end of the history list without actually executing them, so that they are available for
subsequent recall.
