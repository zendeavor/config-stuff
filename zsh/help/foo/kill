kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] [pid | jobspec] ...
kill -l [sigspec | exit status]
       Send the signal named by sigspec or signum to the processes named by pid or jobspec.  sigspec  is  either  a  case-
       insensitive  signal  name  such  as SIGKILL (with or without the SIG prefix) or a signal number; signum is a signal
       number.  If sigspec is not present, then SIGTERM is assumed.  An argument of -l lists the  signal  names.   If  any
       arguments  are  supplied  when -l is given, the names of the signals corresponding to the arguments are listed, and
       the return status is 0.  The exit status argument to -l is a number specifying either a signal number or  the  exit
       status  of  a  process  terminated by a signal.  kill returns true if at least one signal was successfully sent, or
       false if an error occurs or an invalid option is encountered.
