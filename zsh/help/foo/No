No parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, or pathname expansion is performed on  word.   If  any
characters  in  word  are quoted, the delimiter is the result of quote removal on word, and the lines in the here-document
are not expanded.  If word is unquoted, all lines of the here-document are subjected to parameter expansion, command  sub‚Äê
stitution, and arithmetic expansion.  In the latter case, the character sequence \<newline> is ignored, and \ must be used
to quote the characters \, $, and `.
