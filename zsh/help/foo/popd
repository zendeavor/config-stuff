popd [-n] [+n] [-n]
       Removes  entries  from  the directory stack.  With no arguments, removes the top directory from the stack, and per‚Äê
       forms a cd to the new top directory.  Arguments, if supplied, have the following meanings:
       -n     Suppresses the normal change of directory when removing directories from the stack, so that only  the  stack
              is manipulated.
       +n     Removes  the  nth  entry counting from the left of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero.  For example:
              ``popd +0'' removes the first directory, ``popd +1'' the second.
       -n     Removes the nth entry counting from the right of the list shown by dirs, starting with zero.   For  example:
              ``popd -0'' removes the last directory, ``popd -1'' the next to last.

       If  the popd command is successful, a dirs is performed as well, and the return status is 0.  popd returns false if
       an invalid option is encountered, the directory stack is empty, a non-existent directory stack entry is  specified,
       or the directory change fails.
