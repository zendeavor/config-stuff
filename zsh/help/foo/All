All other aspects of the shell execution environment are identical between a function and its  caller  with  these  excep‚Äê
tions:   the  DEBUG  and RETURN traps (see the description of the trap builtin under SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS below) are not
inherited unless the function has been given the trace attribute (see the description of the declare builtin below) or the
-o  functrace shell option has been enabled with the set builtin (in which case all functions inherit the DEBUG and RETURN
traps), and the ERR trap is not inherited unless the -o errtrace shell option has been enabled.
