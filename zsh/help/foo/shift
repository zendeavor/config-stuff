shift [n]
       The  positional  parameters  from  n+1 ... are renamed to $1 ....  Parameters represented by the numbers $# down to
       $#-n+1 are unset.  n must be a non-negative number less than or equal to $#.  If n is 0, no parameters are changed.
       If n is not given, it is assumed to be 1.  If n is greater than $#, the positional parameters are not changed.  The
       return status is greater than zero if n is greater than $# or less than zero; otherwise 0.
