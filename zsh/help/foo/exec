exec [-cl] [-a name] [command [arguments]]
       If  command is specified, it replaces the shell.  No new process is created.  The arguments become the arguments to
       command.  If the -l option is supplied, the shell places a dash at the beginning of the zeroth argument  passed  to
       command.   This  is what login(1) does.  The -c option causes command to be executed with an empty environment.  If
       -a is supplied, the shell passes name as the zeroth argument to the executed command.  If command  cannot  be  exe‐
       cuted for some reason, a non-interactive shell exits, unless the shell option execfail is enabled, in which case it
       returns failure.  An interactive shell returns failure if the file cannot be executed.  If command  is  not  speci‐
       fied,  any  redirections  take  effect in the current shell, and the return status is 0.  If there is a redirection
       error, the return status is 1.
