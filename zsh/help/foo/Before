Before a command is executed, its input and output may be redirected using a special notation interpreted  by  the  shell.
Redirection may also be used to open and close files for the current shell execution environment.  The following redirect‚Äê
ion operators may precede or appear anywhere within a simple command or may follow a command.  Redirections are  processed
in the order they appear, from left to right.
