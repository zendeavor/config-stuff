builtin shell-builtin [arguments]
       Execute  the specified shell builtin, passing it arguments, and return its exit status.  This is useful when defin‚Äê
       ing a function whose name is the same as a shell builtin, retaining the functionality of  the  builtin  within  the
       function.   The  cd  builtin  is commonly redefined this way.  The return status is false if shell-builtin is not a
       shell builtin command.
