unset [-fv] [name ...]
       For each name, remove the corresponding variable or function.  If no options are supplied,  or  the  -v  option  is
       given,  each name refers to a shell variable.  Read-only variables may not be unset.  If -f is specified, each name
       refers to a shell function, and the function definition is removed.  Each unset variable  or  function  is  removed
       from  the  environment passed to subsequent commands.  If any of COMP WORDBREAKS, RANDOM, SECONDS, LINENO, HISTCMD,
       FUNCNAME, GROUPS, or DIRSTACK are unset, they lose their special properties, even if they are  subsequently  reset.
       The exit status is true unless a name is readonly.
