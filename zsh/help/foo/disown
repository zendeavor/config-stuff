disown [-ar] [-h] [jobspec ...]
       Without options, each jobspec is removed from the table of active jobs.  If jobspec is not present, and neither  -a
       nor  -r is supplied, the shell's notion of the current job is used.  If the -h option is given, each jobspec is not
       removed from the table, but is marked so that SIGHUP is not sent to the job if the shell receives a SIGHUP.  If  no
       jobspec  is  present,  and neither the -a nor the -r option is supplied, the current job is used.  If no jobspec is
       supplied, the -a option means to remove or mark all jobs; the -r option without a jobspec argument restricts opera‚Äê
       tion to running jobs.  The return value is 0 unless a jobspec does not specify a valid job.
