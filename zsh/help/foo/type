type [-aftpP] name [name ...]
       With no options, indicate how each name would be interpreted if used as a command name.  If the -t option is  used,
       type prints a string which is one of alias, keyword, function, builtin, or file if name is an alias, shell reserved
       word, function, builtin, or disk file, respectively.  If the name is not found, then nothing  is  printed,  and  an
       exit  status  of  false  is returned.  If the -p option is used, type either returns the name of the disk file that
       would be executed if name were specified as a command name, or nothing if ``type -t name'' would not  return  file.
       The  -P option forces a PATH search for each name, even if ``type -t name'' would not return file.  If a command is
       hashed, -p and -P print the hashed value, not necessarily the file that appears first in PATH.  If the -a option is
       used, type prints all of the places that contain an executable named name.  This includes aliases and functions, if
       and only if the -p option is not also used.  The table of hashed commands is not consulted when using -a.   The  -f
       option  suppresses  shell  function lookup, as with the command builtin.  type returns true if all of the arguments
       are found, false if any are not found.
