By  default,  if a compspec is found, whatever it generates is returned to the completion code as the full set of possible
completions.  The default bash completions are not attempted, and the readline default of filename completion is disabled.
If  the  -o  bashdefault  option  was supplied to complete when the compspec was defined, the bash default completions are
attempted if the compspec generates no matches.  If the -o default option was supplied to complete when the  compspec  was
defined, readline's default completion will be performed if the compspec (and, if attempted, the default bash completions)
generate no matches.
