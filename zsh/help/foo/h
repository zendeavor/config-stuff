h      Remove a trailing file name component, leaving only the head.
t      Remove all leading file name components, leaving the tail.
r      Remove a trailing suffix of the form .xxx, leaving the basename.
e      Remove all but the trailing suffix.
p      Print the new command but do not execute it.
q      Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions.
x      Quote the substituted words as with q, but break into words at blanks and newlines.
s/old/new/
       Substitute new for the first occurrence of old in the event line.  Any delimiter can be used in place  of  /.   The
       final  delimiter is optional if it is the last character of the event line.  The delimiter may be quoted in old and
       new with a single backslash.  If & appears in new, it is replaced by old.  A single backslash will quote the &.  If
       old  is  null, it is set to the last old substituted, or, if no previous history substitutions took place, the last
       string in a !?string[?]  search.
&      Repeat the previous substitution.
g      Cause changes to be  applied  over  the  entire  event  line.   This  is  used  in  conjunction  with  `:s'  (e.g.,
       `:gs/old/new/')  or  `:&'.   If used with `:s', any delimiter can be used in place of /, and the final delimiter is
       optional if it is the last character of the event line.  An a may be used as a synonym for g.
G      Apply the following `s' modifier once to each word in the event line.
