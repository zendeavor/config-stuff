jobs [-lnprs] [ jobspec ... ]
jobs -x command [ args ... ]
       The first form lists the active jobs.  The options have the following meanings:
       -l     List process IDs in addition to the normal information.
       -n     Display  information only about jobs that have changed status since the user was last notified of their sta‚Äê
              tus.
       -p     List only the process ID of the job's process group leader.
       -r     Restrict output to running jobs.
       -s     Restrict output to stopped jobs.

       If jobspec is given, output is restricted to information about that job.  The return status is 0 unless an  invalid
       option is encountered or an invalid jobspec is supplied.

       If  the  -x  option  is supplied, jobs replaces any jobspec found in command or args with the corresponding process
       group ID, and executes command passing it args, returning its exit status.
