umask [-p] [-S] [mode]
       The user file-creation mask is set to mode.  If mode begins with a digit, it is interpreted  as  an  octal  number;
       otherwise  it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar to that accepted by chmod(1).  If mode is omitted, the
       current value of the mask is printed.  The -S option causes the mask to be printed in symbolic  form;  the  default
       output  is an octal number.  If the -p option is supplied, and mode is omitted, the output is in a form that may be
       reused as input.  The return status is 0 if the mode was successfully changed or if no mode argument was  supplied,
       and false otherwise.
