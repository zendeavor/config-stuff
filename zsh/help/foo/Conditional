Conditional  expressions  are  used by the [[ compound command and the test and [ builtin commands to test file attributes
and perform string and arithmetic comparisons.  Expressions are formed from the following unary or binary  primaries.   If
any  file argument to one of the primaries is of the form /dev/fd/n, then file descriptor n is checked.  If the file argu‚Äê
ment to one of the primaries is one of /dev/stdin, /dev/stdout, or /dev/stderr, file descriptor 0, 1, or 2,  respectively,
is checked.
