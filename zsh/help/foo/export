export [-fn] [name[=word]] ...
export -p
       The supplied names are marked for automatic export to the environment of subsequently executed commands.  If the -f
       option is given, the names refer to functions.  If no names are given, or if the -p option is supplied, a  list  of
       all  names that are exported in this shell is printed.  The -n option causes the export property to be removed from
       each name.  If a variable name is followed by =word, the value of the variable is set to word.  export  returns  an
       exit  status  of 0 unless an invalid option is encountered, one of the names is not a valid shell variable name, or
       -f is supplied with a name that is not a function.
