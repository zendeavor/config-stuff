compgen [option] [word]
       Generate  possible  completion  matches  for word according to the options, which may be any option accepted by the
       complete builtin with the exception of -p and -r, and write the matches to the standard output.  When using the  -F
       or -C options, the various shell variables set by the programmable completion facilities, while available, will not
       have useful values.

       The matches will be generated in the same way as if the programmable completion code had  generated  them  directly
       from  a  completion  specification with the same flags.  If word is specified, only those completions matching word
       will be displayed.

       The return value is true unless an invalid option is supplied, or no matches were generated.
