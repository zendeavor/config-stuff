caller [expr]
       Returns the context of any active subroutine call (a shell function or a script  executed  with  the  .  or  source
       builtins).  Without expr, caller displays the line number and source filename of the current subroutine call.  If a
       non-negative integer is supplied as expr, caller displays the line number, subroutine name, and source file  corre‐
       sponding to that position in the current execution call stack.  This extra information may be used, for example, to
       print a stack trace.  The current frame is frame 0.  The return value is 0 unless the shell is not executing a sub‐
       routine call or expr does not correspond to a valid position in the call stack.
