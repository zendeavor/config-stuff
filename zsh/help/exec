exec [ -cl ] [ -a argv0 ] simple command
       Replace  the  current  shell  with an external command rather than forking.  With -c clear the environment; with -l
       prepend - to the argv[0] string of the command executed (to simulate a login shell); with -a argv0 set the  argv[0]
       string of the command executed.  See the section `Precommand Modifiers'.
