ulimit [ [ -SHacdfilmnpqstvx | -N resource [ limit ] ... ]
       Set  or  display  resource limits of the shell and the processes started by the shell.  The value of limit can be a
       number in the unit specified below or one of the values `unlimited', which removes the limit on  the  resource,  or
       `hard', which uses the current value of the hard limit on the resource.

       By  default,  only soft limits are manipulated. If the -H flag is given use hard limits instead of soft limits.  If
       the -S flag is given together with the -H flag set both hard and soft limits.

       If no options are used, the file size limit (-f) is assumed.

       If limit is omitted the current value of the specified resources are printed.  When more than one resource value is
       printed, the limit name and unit is printed before each value.

       When looping over multiple resources, the shell will abort immediately if it detects a badly formed argument.  How‚Äê
       ever, if it fails to set a limit for some other reason it will continue trying to set the remaining limits.

       -a     Lists all of the current resource limits.
       -c     512-byte blocks on the size of core dumps.
       -d     K-bytes on the size of the data segment.
       -f     512-byte blocks on the size of files written.
       -i     The number of pending signals.
       -l     K-bytes on the size of locked-in memory.
       -m     K-bytes on the size of physical memory.
       -n     open file descriptors.
       -q     Bytes in POSIX message queues.
       -s     K-bytes on the size of the stack.
       -t     CPU seconds to be used.
       -u     processes available to the user.
       -v     K-bytes on the size of virtual memory.  On some systems this refers to the limit called `address space'.
       -x     The number of locks on files.

       A resource may also be specified by integer in the form `-N resource', where resource corresponds  to  the  integer
       defined  for  the  resource by the operating system.  This may be used to set the limits for resources known to the
       shell which do not correspond to option letters.  Such limits will be shown by number in the output of `ulimit -a'.

       The number may alternatively be out of the range of limits compiled into the shell.  The shell will try to read  or
       write the limit anyway, and will report an error if this fails.
