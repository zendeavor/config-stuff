exit [ n ]
       Exit the shell with the exit status specified by n; if none is specified, use the exit status from the last command
       executed.  An EOF condition will also cause the shell to exit, unless the IGNORE EOF option is set.

bye    Same as exit.

logout [ n ]
       Same as exit, except that it only works in a login shell.
